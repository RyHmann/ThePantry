[{"Name":"Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Broccoli Rabe and Garlic Sage Butter Sauce","Description":"Sweet Potato Gnocchi! The easiest and best way to make Sweet Potato Gnocchi! Serve it with broccoli rabe and garlic sage butter sauce for a BOMB meal.","Instructions":"1. For the gnocchi: Stick the sweet potato a few times with a fork, wrap in a damp paper towel, and microwave until soft, about 7 minutes. (You can also bake the sweet potato in the oven, which will take closer to an hour.)2. Scoop the flesh of the sweet potato into a mixing bowl. Discard the skin. Mix the ricotta, parmesan, and salt until well combined and almost completely smooth. Add the flour 1/2 cup at a time, kneading very gently after each addition (don\u2019t over knead it \u2013 you don\u2019t want it to get tough).3. Eventually, as the dough becomes easier to handle, transfer it to a clean floured work surface and form it into a loaf, about 9\u00D75 inches. Cut a slice off of the loaf on the short side (think of it as if it were a loaf of banana bread and you were going to cut a slice to eat). Roll and stretch the slice on a floured surface until it forms a long, skinny rope-like shape. Cut the rope into 1-inch segments and transfer to a bowl: this is your gnocchi.4. Bring a large pot of water to boil, add the gnocchi, and boil until the gnocchi rise to the top of the water. Drain and toss gently with a little olive oil to prevent sticking. At this point you can make the rest of the recipe with the gnocchi, refrigerate the gnocchi to finish them later, or freeze them.5. For the Broccoli Rabe (optional): Bring a large pot of water to boil and prepare a bowl with ice water. Add the broccoli rabe to the boiling water and cook for 1 minute. Drain and transfer to the ice water to cool and stop the broccoli rabe from cooking further. Drain again and set aside.6. Putting it all together: Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat until lightly bubbling and foaming. Add the gnocchi and pan-fry until golden brown on the outside (you may have to do this in batches). Once the gnocchi is done, add the broccoli rabe, garlic, sage, and salt and pan-fry for another few minutes (again, working in batches). Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes so the butter thickens just a little. Add the cream to the pan along with the Parmesan cheese \u2013 toss gently a few times to combine (the sauce should coat the gnocchi and broccoli rabe very lightly) and serve immediately with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice if you want.","MealIngredients":["sweet potato","whole milk ricotta cheese","Parmesan cheese","salt","flour","broccoli rabe","butter","heavy cream","garlic","sage leaves","sea salt","Parmesan cheese"],"URL":"https://pinchofyum.com/sweet-potato-gnocchi","Thumbnail":"pinchofyum_sweetpotatognocchiwithbroccolirabeandgarlicsagebuttersauce.jpeg"},{"Name":"Sarah\u0026#8217;s White Chicken Chili","Description":"White Chicken Chili!

Food processor prep: Pulse the bacon through the food processor until it looks like a chunky paste. Remove bacon and do the same with the onion, garlic, and jalape\u00F1o.2. Cook bacon and veggies: Add the bacon to a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Once the bacon starts heating up, add the onion, garlic, and jalape\u00F1o mix so it all cooks together.3. Build the soup: Add spices, broth, and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer.4. Cook chicken: Add chicken. Bring to a low simmer. Cover and cook for 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.

Browned butter and brown sugar caramely goodness, crispy edges, barely thick and soft centers, and melty little puddles of chocolate chips.","Instructions":"1. Brown the butter: Cut the butter into small pieces for even melting. Melt the butter in a wide stainless steel skillet over medium heat. Swirl the pan a few times as the butter melts. It will get bubbly and then foamy \u2013 use a heat-proof spatula to scrape the butter across the bottom of the pan to prevent burning. You\u2019ll see the butter start to turn golden brown very quickly, and you\u2019ll be able to smell it (yum). When it is a nice golden brown color, remove from heat and transfer to a cool bowl or glass measuring cup, being careful not to burn it. The whole process should take about 5 minutes. Let the butter cool for another 5-10 minutes while you measure and prep everything else.2. Add the butter, sugars, and vanilla to the bowl of an electric mixture. Beat on medium high speed for 2-3 minutes.3. Add the eggs and beat for 1-2 minutes until shiny and smooth.\u00A04. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix until just combined into a dense, shiny dough. Let the dough cool for 15-20 minutes (if you add the chocolate chips now, they will melt).5. Mix in the chocolate chips or chunks (sometimes it helps to do this by hand). Let the dough rest for another 20-30 minutes. This helps hydrate the flour and carry the browned butter flavor farther in the cookies.6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Roll or scoop your cookie dough into 3-tablespoon balls onto a baking sheet. Bake for 9 minutes, until the edges look cooked but the middles are still slightly soft and puffy.\u00A07. Remove from the oven and let the cookies rest for 15-20 minutes. I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW this is very hard. But as they rest, the middles are going to sink down and kind of densify the middle, so you get that crispy exterior with the barely-thick, underbaked center.","MealIngredients":["unsalted butter","white sugar","brown sugar","vanilla","eggs","flour","baking soda","baking powder","salt","chocolate chips or chocolate chunks"],"URL":"https://pinchofyum.com/browned-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies","Thumbnail":"pinchofyum_favoritebrownedbutterchocolatechipcookies.jpeg"},{"Name":"The Best Detox Crockpot Lentil Soup","Description":"Detox Crockpot Lentil Soup \u0026#8211; a clean and simple soup made with onions, garlic, carrots, olive oil, squash, and LENTILS!

Place about 4 cups of soup in a blender with the olive oil. Pulse gently until semi-smooth and creamy-looking (the oil will form a creamy emulsion with the soup).

No chilling required. Just ultra thick, soft, classic chocolate chip cookies!","Instructions":"1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn\u2019t be hot \u2013 but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.2. Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated \u2013 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).3. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between \u201Cwet\u201D dough and \u201Cdry\u201D dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.4. Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden.Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they\u2019re not done yet (see picture in the post). They\u2019ll be pale and puffy.5. Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container.

Ham and Spinach:\u00A0Toss the ham in a skillet with a quick drizzle of olive oil. Pan-fry until the edges are kind of browned and some of the fat is rendered. Throw in your spinach. Stir to wilt the spinach. Remove from heat.3. Eggs:\u00A0Whisk eggs with the milk, dijon, salt, and pepper.4. Layer: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9\u00D713 baking dish.

Thick, hearty, slow-simmered chili makes for the BEST comfort food (and leftovers)!","Instructions":"1. Mix salt with ground beef. Set aside so it can get nice and salty while you prep the other ingredients. In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, fry your bacon pieces until crispy. Drain on paper towel lined plates.

Brown until fully cooked.4. Add the tomato paste. Saut\u00E9 for 2-3 minutes.5. Add tomatoes, beans, broth, and bacon. Bring to a low simmer. Cover it and let it hang out over low heat for at least 30-45 minutes, but ideally 2\u002B hours (this helps the flavors develop and this is why it\u2019s Sunday chili). You can alternate between\u00A0 keeping it over a low flame and just letting it rest in the hot pot. It will thicken, so use extra water or broth to thin it out to desired consistency.6. BOOM! Top with all your favorite toppings.

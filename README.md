# ThePantry
Ingredient focused Recipe Book Web Application

I wanted to make a web application that took into account the user's ingredients, and suggested recipes based on these ingredients. The user will also be able to generate a shopping list based on ingredients required for a recipe that the user would like to create.

This is the third iteration of my idea. This iteration of ThePantry utilizing ASP.NET Core and Entity Frameworks as a backend, paired with a SPA front end utilizing Angular.

# The-Pantry: An Ingredient-centric Recipe App
A web app that searches for recipes based on your ingredients

The-Pantry is a place where you can search for recipes by ingredient, or search for recipes and exclude specifc ingredients! All results come from our selective database. We hand-picked and curated this database based on quality recipes from great cooks. A query isn't going to return 200,000 results of junk data. We think your searches will lead to great meals.
